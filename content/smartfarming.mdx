## Timeline
October 2024 - Desember 2024  

## Description
The Smart Farming Agrilink Vocpro project integrates modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to enhance agricultural productivity and efficiency. Focused on Japanese pumpkin cultivation, this initiative employs IoT sensors, automated irrigation, and big data for real-time monitoring of soil, humidity, and climate conditions. It also incorporates project-based learning, engaging students in end-to-end processes from cultivation to product development such as pastries and ice cream. The software architecture includes AdonisJS, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, Flutter, and Angular, with features like sensor data visualization via Grafana, and mobile control of greenhouse devices. The project ultimately aims to empower students with practical agricultural technology, marketing, and sustainable farming skills.
